Broadcaster - The device is an advertiser that is non connectable.
Observer - The device scans for advertisements but cannot initiate connections.
Peripheral - The device is an advertiser that is connectable and operates as slave in a single

                 link-layer connection.
Central - The device scans for advertisements and initiates connections and operates as a master

                  in a single or multiple link-layer connections.

Scanning Basics

When not connected, Bluetooth devices can either advertise their presence by
transmitting advertisement packets or scan for nearby devices that are
advertising. This process of scanning for devices is called device discovery.
There are two types of scanning; active and passive. The difference is that an
active scanner can send a scan request to request additional information from
the advertiser, while a passive scanner can only receive data from advertising
device.
Note that the terms discovery and scanning may be used interchangeably. The
figure below shows the sequence where the scanner sends a scan request to
an advertiser during an advertising event.

                                                                                                            OPULINKS TECH. LTD. CONFIDENTIAL

GATT describes a service framework using the Attribute Protocol (ATT) to discover, read, write,
 notify and indicate characteristics, as well as to configure the broadcast of characteristics. GATT is
 designed for an application or another profile to communicate with a peer device.

                                                                                                              OPULINKS TECH. LTD. CONFIDENTIAL

  Attributes is the smallest data entity of GATT (also ATT). GATT (ATT) can run only through

(3) Characteristic Descriptor Declarations

    Characteristic Descriptors are like additional supplementary information of data, after the characteristic value attribute,
     and each descriptor is a single attribute, and there are two types: official (GATT-defined descriptors) and unofficial
     (Profile or vendor-defined descriptors).

    Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor(CCCD):
   Generally speaking, client accesses (reads and writes) the characteristics of the server. The server can also directly tell the
   client the value of its characteristic. This function is called notify &Indicate. Compared with the original operation, it will
   only be sent when data needs to be transmitted. , saving server power consumption. The function of CCCD is to set the
   client's willingness to receive notify and indicate.

  • The central device will scan nearby peripherals to see if any of them provide a service UUID
    that matches one we are interested in, and then connect to retrieve it.

Example description

  • The Heart Rate Collector application implements the Collector role for the Heart Rate Profile. It scans
     peripheral devices, connects to the device advertising with Heart Rate Service UUID in its advertisement
     report, and discovers and configures the Heart Rate Service to start sending Notifications of Heart Rate
     Measurement. The Heart Rate Measurement received is logged on UART interface. This application will
     also discover and configure Battery Service at the peer.

 Step:

  • Set scan , connection parameter and target service UUID
  • Start scanning
  • Get scan result and find target service UUID
  • Connect to target peripheral
  • Discover all primary services
  • Discover all characteristic descriptors
  • Read GAP GATT service’s “Device name”
  • Characteristic Read/Write/Notify operation
  • Disconnect the devices, for example execute “at+blediscon” on the Central, the central

    automatically reconnect and that Heart Rate measurements are displayed on the UART.
